_The process of preparing programms for a digital computer is especially atrractive, not only because it can be economically and scientifically rewarding, but also because it can be an aesthetic experience much like composing poetry or music._

This is an ongoing recreational effort in whatever langauge I want, going through some points in The Art of Compute Programming 3rd Edition.

It is for my own pleasure and may be flawed and may never get anywhere.

Please do not judge. Push corrections if you like.
