_The process of preparing programs for a digital computer is especially attractive, not only because it can be economically and scientifically rewarding, but also because it can be an aesthetic experience much like composing poetry or music._

This is an ongoing recreational effort in whatever language I want, going through some points in The Art of Computer Programming 3rd Edition.

It is for my own pleasure and may be flawed and may never get anywhere.

Please do not judge. Push corrections if you like. Sometimes it is easier for me to edit this README on the fly on my phone. So it acts like a 'buffer' p216 :)

on the fly:

Ch.1 continued 

v1_p25 

1 Q smallest positive rational?
  A 1/inf, i.e. NaN i.e. there ain't one

3 Q what is (-3)^-3
  A its the reciprocal of the cube of -3 
    so it's one over twenty seven

4 Q what is (0.125)^-2/3

  A the operand is an eighth
    the reciprocal of 2^3 as it were
    the minus power means reciprocate
    so it becomes 8 after that
    and two thirds means get the cube root of the square
    which is the cube root 64
    that is 4 

<pretty familiar with binomials, come back to Striling later after reading Strang leafed through algo analysis, generating functions, fib, O-notation, to s1.3 p123 which is where assembler starts

leafed theough MIX end on through Chap 1 
e.g. work on permutations at 1.3.3 quite like my thesis work amd 1.4 subroutines quite like functions/multiple dispatch and thebIO stuffnis intersting but I biffed along to INFORMATION STRUCTURES
    
notes 2.1 Information Structures
- the address of a node is the memeory location of its first word 
- Lambda denotes null link or ground
- Top card indicated by a link from TOP
- fields within nodes
    e.g. CONTENTS(LOC(V)) = V
    as we have met in dancing links
- watch out for MIXAL referring to addresses and algo notation referring to variables
