_The process of preparing programs for a digital computer is especially attractive, not only because it can be economically and scientifically rewarding, but also because it can be an aesthetic experience much like composing poetry or music._

This is an ongoing recreational effort in whatever language I want, going through some points in The Art of Computer Programming 3rd Edition.

It is for my own pleasure and may be flawed and may never get anywhere.

Please do not judge. Push corrections if you like.

v1_p25 

1 Q smallest positive rational?
  A 1/inf, i.e. NaN i.e. there ain't one

3 Q what is (-3)^-3
  A its the reciprocal of the cube of -3 
    so it's one over twenty seven

4 Q what is (0.125)^-2/3

  A the operand is an eighth
    the reciprocal of 2^3 as it were
    the minus power means reciprocate
    so it becomes 8 after that
    and two thirds means get the cube root of the square
    which is the cube root 64
    that is 4
