Algorithm E (Euclid's Algorithm) Given two positive integers _m_ and _n_ find their _gratst common divisor_, that is,  the largest positive integer that evenly divides both _m_ and _n_.

exanple: 16 and 24 have gcd 8

  (2 yes 3 no 4 yes 5 no 6 no 7 no 8 yes and 9 is too big because 2 yes so common divisors are 2,4,8 and 8 is greatest)
