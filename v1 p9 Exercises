1 Q rearrange four variables abcd to bcda by a sequence of replacements in fewest n of replacements
  A move a if allowed

2 Q prove m is greater than n at beginning of E1 except possibly the frist time E1 occurs
  A n is initilsed as a remainder and remainders are smaller than numerators

3 Q Change E so that trivial replacements like m <- n are avoided, write in style of E, call F
A

Algo F

    DEK did this

    F1. m = remainder m/n
    F2. if m == 0
          return n
    F3. n = remainder n/m
    F4. if n == 0
          return m
        else 
          goto F1.

    F1. m = remainder m/n
          = r(24/16)
          = 8 
    F2. if m == 0
          FALSE
          ...
    F3. n = remainder n/m
    F4. if n == 0
          TRUE
          return m
          RETURN 8
        else 
          ...

    BRILIIANT

6 Q What is T5, average number of times E1 is 
  A ok what is the domain of m? 
    0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8... \inf reduces to 
    m+1,+2,+3,+4,+5
    and count from there, cheat asnwer is 2.6

7 Q Let Um = average n times E1 is executedif m is known and n is all positive ints
    IS Um related to Tm? 
    I woudl say they are the same
    But what I missed is that U has all ints and T has only those greater

skipped 8 and 9 maybe come back maybe not
